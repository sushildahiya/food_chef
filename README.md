## Code Optimization

The code has been optimized for better performance and readability. Here are the key optimizations made:

1. Utilized `const` and `let` instead of `var` for variable declarations.

3. Used template literals for string concatenation.
4. Removed unused variables and unnecessary parts of the code.
